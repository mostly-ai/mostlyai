    Entrypoint for the Synthetic Data SDK Docker image.
    Can be called without any arguments which would start in a Local mode, running on port 8080.
    Alternatively, any arguments can be passed as key-value pairs and they will be used when initiating the MostlyAI class.

    Example:
    ```bash
    docker run mostlyai/mostlyai
    # Connected to http://127.0.0.1:8080 with 16 GB RAM, 11 CPUs, 0 GPUs available

    docker run mostlyai/mostlyai --local=True --local_port=8082 --ssl_verify=False
    # Connected to http://127.0.0.1:8082 with 16 GB RAM, 11 CPUs, 0 GPUs available
