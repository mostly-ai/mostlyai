    "After generating synthetic data using both SDV and MOSTLY AI, it's crucial to comprehensively evaluate the quality, privacy, and integrity of the generated datasets. This section provides a multi-faceted quality assessment framework that ensures our synthetic data meets production standards.\n",

    "The MOSTLY AI QA library provides enterprise-grade quality assessment capabilities that evaluate synthetic data across multiple dimensions. This assessment generates comprehensive HTML reports and quantitative metrics that help understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy Scores**: Overall statistical fidelity of synthetic data\n",
    "- **Distance to Closest Record (DCR)**: Privacy risk measurement \n",
    "- **Univariate & Bivariate Distributions**: Preservation of individual column and column-pair statistics\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**: Maintenance of relationships between variables\n",
    "- **Similarity Metrics**: Overall resemblance to training data while avoiding overfitting"
